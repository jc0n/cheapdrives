# Cheapdrives

## About

A brief Python script by John O'Connor to find reasonably priced hard drives
from popular vendors for a bulk storage array. The script works by parsing RSS
or Atom feeds and extracting the size and price of the drives to compute a
price/GB ratio which is then sorted.

## Installation

    $ python setup.py install
    _(sudo) if necessary_

## Usage

Specify a file which contains one feed URL per line

    $ cheapdrives spindles.list

or manually specify one or more URLs on the command line

    $ cheapdrives http://some_url/with_rss_feed
